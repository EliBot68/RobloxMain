# PROJECT ISSUES

## ErrorHandlingIntegration.luau

- **Line 20**: Missing error handling in Init method
  - Description: The Init method lacks error boundaries and doesn't handle potential failures from service initialization. If any service fails to initialize, the entire integration will fail without proper error reporting or recovery.

- **Line 25-28**: Service initialization without validation
  - Description: Services are initialized without checking if they are nil or if initialization was successful. This could lead to nil reference errors later in the code.

- **Line 53**: Return value inconsistency
  - Description: The Init method returns `self`, but this pattern is inconsistent with typical Lua/Luau initialization patterns and could confuse callers about whether to use the returned value or the original object.

- **Line 61**: Module architecture issue
  - Description: Using `ConfigurationManager.getInstance()` repeatedly throughout the file creates unnecessary coupling and potential performance issues. Should cache the instance once.

- **Line 66**: Variable shadowing potential
  - Description: Parameter name `error` in the lambda function could shadow the global `error` function, potentially causing confusion or bugs.

- **Line 73**: Network failure handling incomplete
  - Description: The HttpService:PostAsync call inside pcall only logs warnings on failure but doesn't implement retry logic or circuit breaker patterns for external service failures.

- **Line 74**: HttpService availability not checked
  - Description: HttpService might not be available in certain contexts (like Studio testing) and should be checked before use.

- **Line 107**: Dead code/Placeholder implementation
  - Description: Comment indicates "In a real implementation, you'd send this to your logging service" but the code stores data nowhere, making this feature non-functional.

- **Line 163**: Deprecated wait function usage
  - Description: Using `wait(3)` is deprecated in modern Roblox development. Should use `task.wait(3)` instead.

- **Line 169**: Event-driven implementation but still uses spawn
  - Description: While trying to be event-driven, the code still uses `spawn` which creates threads unnecessarily. Should use proper event connections.

- **Line 172**: Recursive spawn calls
  - Description: The schedulePerformanceMonitoring function calls spawn recursively, which could lead to stack overflow or memory leaks over time.

- **Line 180**: Global function override security risk
  - Description: Overriding global `spawn` and `delay` functions could break other modules that depend on the original behavior, creating hard-to-debug issues.

- **Line 202**: Global function override security risk
  - Description: Same issue as spawn - overriding global `delay` function is dangerous and could break other code.

- **Line 230**: Performance monitoring uses polling
  - Description: Despite comments about being "event-driven", this implementation still uses polling via RunService.Heartbeat, which contradicts the stated architectural goals.

- **Line 243**: Expensive operations in tight loop
  - Description: Calling `workspace:GetDescendants()` and `#game:GetService("Players"):GetPlayers()` on every heartbeat is very expensive and will cause performance issues.

- **Line 287**: Hardcoded function names
  - Description: The functionsToProfile table contains hardcoded strings that may not correspond to actual functions, making this feature fragile and non-functional.

- **Line 301**: Non-functional profiling implementation
  - Description: The automatic profiling only logs that it "would" profile functions but doesn't actually implement any profiling, making this feature useless.

- **Line 320**: Mixed memory measurement APIs
  - Description: Uses both `collectgarbage("count")` and `gcinfo()` for memory measurement in different places, which is inconsistent and could give different results.

- **Line 327**: Recursive function without base case protection
  - Description: scheduleMemoryCheck calls itself recursively without any termination condition, potentially leading to stack overflow.

- **Line 351**: String concatenation in hot path
  - Description: Creating snapshot names with `"event_driven_" .. tick()` on every memory check is inefficient and could cause GC pressure.

- **Line 367**: Mixed async patterns
  - Description: Using both `spawn` and event-driven patterns in the same function creates confusion about the execution model.

- **Line 370**: Nested spawn calls
  - Description: spawn() inside spawn() creates unnecessary thread nesting and complexity.

- **Line 375**: Inconsistent wait vs task.wait
  - Description: Uses `wait(interval)` instead of modern `task.wait(interval)`, mixing old and new async patterns.

- **Line 385**: spawn in event-driven system
  - Description: Using spawn() in what's supposed to be an event-driven system contradicts the architectural pattern.

- **Line 410**: Test pollution in production code
  - Description: Test setup code is mixed with production initialization logic, violating separation of concerns.

- **Line 420**: Missing test isolation
  - Description: Tests modify shared state (errorHandler logger) without proper cleanup, potentially affecting other tests or production code.

- **Line 426**: API assumption without validation
  - Description: Tests assume specific API methods exist on services without checking, making tests brittle.

- **Line 451**: Missing error handling in public API
  - Description: Public API methods like GetErrorHandler() don't check if the service was properly initialized before returning potentially nil values.

- **Line 467**: Inconsistent error reporting
  - Description: LogError method creates error objects inconsistent with the errorHandler's expected format from other parts of the codebase.

- **Line 479**: API method parameter validation missing
  - Description: StartProfiling and EndProfiling methods don't validate their parameters, potentially causing crashes if called with invalid data.

- **Line 488**: Module doesn't follow service pattern
  - Description: The module returns a table instead of following the established service initialization pattern used elsewhere in the codebase.

## ServiceRegistry.luau

- **Line 8**: Unused import with underscore prefix
  - Description: _SafeRequire is imported but never used. Either use it or remove the import to reduce memory usage and confusion.

- **Line 13**: Global singleton anti-pattern
  - Description: Using a global singleton instance variable makes testing difficult and creates hidden dependencies. Should use dependency injection instead.

- **Line 64**: Missing duplicate service check
  - Description: While the method warns about duplicate registrations, it should return early instead of continuing execution which could cause confusion.

- **Line 78**: Unvalidated config parameter
  - Description: The config parameter is not validated for required fields or correct types before use, which could cause runtime errors.

- **Line 87**: Metrics without thread safety
  - Description: Multiple threads could modify metrics concurrently without synchronization, leading to incorrect counts.

- **Line 92**: Potential memory leak in response time calculation
  - Description: The _updateResponseTime method is called on every service request but doesn't protect against overflow in calculations with large numbers.

- **Line 109**: Error state corruption risk
  - Description: Service error state is modified without ensuring atomicity, potentially leaving services in inconsistent states.

- **Line 137**: Circular dependency in initialization
  - Description: Dependencies are resolved during initialization which could cause infinite recursion if two services depend on each other.

- **Line 152**: Type checking insufficient
  - Description: The type checking for serviceClass only checks for function/table types but doesn't validate the actual interface (new method, etc.).

- **Line 161**: Missing initialization validation
  - Description: The code calls instance:Initialize() without checking if the method exists or if it succeeded.

- **Line 175**: Exception handling without cleanup
  - Description: StartAllServices catches errors but doesn't clean up partial initialization states, potentially leaving the system in an inconsistent state.

- **Line 190**: State transition without validation
  - Description: Service state is changed to STARTING without checking if the service is in a valid state to be started.

- **Line 204**: Missing Start method validation
  - Description: The code calls instance:Start() without checking if the method exists first.

- **Line 218**: Missing Stop method validation
  - Description: The code calls instance:Stop() without checking if the method exists first.

- **Line 271**: Inefficient dependency resolution algorithm
  - Description: The topological sort algorithm visits nodes multiple times unnecessarily, making it O(nÂ²) when it could be O(n).

- **Line 275**: Missing dependency validation
  - Description: The dependency resolution doesn't validate that all dependencies actually exist before building the dependency graph.

- **Line 311**: Response time calculation overflow risk
  - Description: The response time calculation could overflow with very large numbers of requests or very long response times.

- **Line 320**: Incomplete cleanup method
  - Description: The cleanup method doesn't reset metrics or the singleton instance, which could cause issues if the registry is reused.

- **Line 331**: Event cleanup without error handling
  - Description: Event cleanup doesn't use pcall, so if event destruction fails, the cleanup method will throw an error.

## SafeRequire.luau

- **Line 2**: Overly verbose comment header
  - Description: The comment header is excessively long and contains unprofessional language like "PROMPT 2 SECOND RUN" which should not be in production code.

- **Line 5**: Misleading enterprise claims
  - Description: Claims to be "enterprise-grade" and "production-ready" but contains many non-production patterns and debugging code.

- **Line 10**: Global mutable state
  - Description: Multiple global variables (moduleCache, loadingStack, etc.) create shared state that makes testing difficult and could cause race conditions.

- **Line 16**: Magic numbers without constants
  - Description: RETRY_ATTEMPTS, RETRY_DELAY, etc. are configured as magic numbers instead of being configurable or having named constants explaining their rationale.

- **Line 25**: Complex nested statistics object
  - Description: The performanceStats object tracks too many metrics in a single place, violating single responsibility principle and making it hard to maintain.

- **Line 33**: Inefficient require implementation
  - Description: The require function recreates the modulePathStr on every call instead of accepting it as a parameter, causing unnecessary string conversions.

- **Line 49**: Poor circular dependency detection
  - Description: The circular dependency detection rebuilds the path string on every check, which is inefficient and could be expensive for deep dependency chains.

- **Line 58**: Excessive retry threshold
  - Description: 15 retry attempts is extremely high and could cause long delays and resource consumption for modules that are fundamentally broken.

- **Line 73**: Inappropriate error spam prevention
  - Description: The global error count check prevents all further requires once a threshold is reached, which could break unrelated modules.

- **Line 81**: Inefficient stack management
  - Description: Using table.insert/remove for stack operations when a simple counter would be more efficient for depth tracking.

- **Line 95**: Exponential backoff without jitter randomization
  - Description: The backoff calculation uses random() but applies it incorrectly, not providing proper jitter to prevent thundering herd problems.

- **Line 118**: Complex performance tracking in hot path
  - Description: The performance statistics calculation is done on every successful require, adding overhead to the critical path.

- **Line 145**: Inefficient string formatting in error messages
  - Description: Multiple string.format calls create unnecessary string allocations during error conditions.

- **Line 165**: Timeout implementation uses polling
  - Description: The timeout mechanism uses busy waiting with task.wait instead of proper cancellation tokens or timeouts.

- **Line 189**: Progress reporting with mutable global state
  - Description: Progress reporting modifies global variables and prints to output, which is inappropriate for a utility library.

- **Line 217**: Complex preload system with unclear benefits
  - Description: The preload system has complex batching logic but doesn't provide clear benefits over simple sequential loading for most use cases.

- **Line 241**: Callback pattern instead of promises/futures
  - Description: Uses callback-based async patterns instead of modern promise-like patterns that would be more maintainable.

- **Line 278**: Recursive function without tail call optimization
  - Description: The processBatch function calls itself recursively, which could cause stack overflow with large module lists.

## ServiceBase.luau

- **Line 19**: Missing parameter validation
  - Description: The name parameter is not validated and could be nil or non-string, leading to unexpected behavior in logging and state management.

- **Line 24**: Direct config access without validation
  - Description: Accessing self.Config.Priority and self.Config.Dependencies without validating the config structure could cause nil reference errors.

- **Line 41**: Event instance created without cleanup tracking
  - Description: The StateChanged BindableEvent is created but not properly tracked for cleanup, potentially causing memory leaks.

- **Line 59**: Variable shadowing in error handling
  - Description: The error variable in pcall shadows the global error function, which could cause confusion and potential bugs.

- **Line 63**: Dependency checking returns hardcoded true
  - Description: CheckDependencies always returns true, making dependency validation non-functional and potentially hiding real dependency issues.

- **Line 78**: Missing return value validation
  - Description: The OnInitialize callback return value is not checked, so failures in custom initialization logic won't be caught.

- **Line 125**: Connection cleanup without error handling
  - Description: Connection disconnection doesn't use pcall, so failed disconnections could prevent proper service shutdown.

- **Line 131**: Table clearing without proper iteration
  - Description: Setting self.Connections = {} doesn't properly clean up existing connections that might still be referenced elsewhere.

- **Line 152**: State change event without error handling
  - Description: Firing the StateChanged event doesn't handle potential errors in event handlers, which could crash the service.

- **Line 161**: Connection management lacks validation
  - Description: AddConnection doesn't validate that the connection parameter is actually a connection object before storing it.

- **Line 169**: Connection removal without existence check
  - Description: RemoveConnection attempts to call Disconnect without verifying the connection is still valid or connected.

- **Line 186**: String formatting without error protection
  - Description: String.format calls in logging methods don't protect against format string mismatches, which could cause runtime errors.

- **Line 217**: Connection count calculation incorrect
  - Description: Using #self.Connections for connection count is wrong since Connections is a dictionary, not an array.

- **Line 234**: Hardcoded health check thresholds
  - Description: The 300-second activity threshold and other health check values are hardcoded instead of being configurable.

- **Line 259**: Task scheduling without cleanup tracking
  - Description: Using task.delay for restart scheduling doesn't track the task for cleanup, potentially causing issues if the service is destroyed.

## MemoryManager.luau

- **Line 24**: String conversion without validation
  - Description: Converting playerId to string without validating it's a valid player ID could cause issues with non-numeric player identifiers.

- **Line 30**: Inefficient array length calculation
  - Description: Using #activeConnections[playerId] on a dictionary-like structure returns incorrect results since connections are stored by name, not array index.

- **Line 32**: Configuration access in critical path
  - Description: Calling config:Get on every connection registration adds unnecessary overhead to a frequently-called function.

- **Line 55**: Type checking without proper validation
  - Description: Using typeof to check for "RBXScriptConnection" doesn't protect against objects that mimic this type but aren't actual connections.

- **Line 76**: Dictionary iteration without safety checks
  - Description: Iterating over activeConnections[playerId] without checking if connections are still valid could cause errors if connections were modified during iteration.

## EventDrivenSystem.luau

- **Line 16**: Configuration instance caching in global scope
  - Description: Caching the configuration instance globally means configuration changes won't be reflected, violating the principle of dynamic configuration.

- **Line 20**: Global mutable state in module
  - Description: Multiple global variables (eventSignals, adaptiveMonitors, etc.) create shared state that makes testing difficult and could cause race conditions.

- **Line 25**: Hardcoded event types in module
  - Description: EVENT_TYPES is defined as a static table instead of being configurable, making it difficult to extend or modify event types at runtime.

- **Line 35**: Magic numbers for monitoring intervals
  - Description: MONITORING_INTERVALS contains hardcoded values without explanation of why these specific intervals were chosen.

- **Line 51**: Event signal reuse without cleanup
  - Description: Returning existing event signals without checking if they're still valid could return corrupted or partially cleaned up signals.

- **Line 56**: Instance creation without error handling
  - Description: Creating BindableEvent instances without pcall protection could fail in certain environments or memory conditions.

- **Line 78**: Connection tracking without cleanup
  - Description: Storing connections in signal.connections array without providing a cleanup mechanism could lead to memory leaks.

- **Line 89**: Owner parameter without validation
  - Description: The owner parameter is stored without validation, allowing any value which could cause issues in debugging and cleanup.

  - Description: When `WorldObjectValidator.performFullValidation()` returns false, the code only warns but continues, potentially causing downstream issues.

- **Line 174**: SafeRequire result not validated before use
  - Description: Services loaded via SafeRequire are stored without checking if the result is actually valid/has expected methods.

- **Line 262**: Service initialization errors not properly propagated
  - Description: Errors during service initialization are caught and warned but don't affect the return value, leading to false success reports.

- **Line 344**: Service start errors not propagated
  - Description: Failed service starts are logged but don't affect overall startup success status.

### Global State Issues
- **Line 14**: Global mutable configuration
  - Description: `SERVICE_CONFIG` is a global mutable table that can be modified from anywhere, making debugging and testing difficult.

  - Description: Player leave handler assumes the player object is valid when cleaning up games, but it could be nil.

### Logic Issues
- **Line 316**: Inconsistent initialization completion check
  - Description: The method returns true even if auto-start is configured but fails to execute properly.

- **Line 471**: State validation allows impossible transitions
  - Description: State transition validation only checks current state, not whether the transition itself is valid (e.g., RunningâPreparing).

- **Line 703**: Duplicate state change in event handler
  - Description: `HandleGameStartedEvent` can trigger another `StartGame` call even if game is already starting, causing race conditions.

  - Description: `GetRecentErrors` creates a new array and copies elements instead of using more efficient slicing.

- **Line 948**: Unbounded error rate calculation
  - Description: Error rate spike detection iterates through all recent errors on every monitoring cycle.

### Memory Management Issues
- **Line 560**: Unbounded critical errors array
  - Description: `criticalErrors` array is limited to 50 entries but uses table.remove(1) which is inefficient for arrays.

- **Line 639**: Custom logs accumulation without cleanup scheduling
  - Description: Custom logs are cleaned up only when they exceed 1000 entries, potentially consuming memory for extended periods.

- **Line 962**: Error registry not properly cleaned during monitoring
  - Description: Error registry cleanup uses pairs() iteration while modifying the table, which can skip entries.

### Hardcoded Values/Magic Numbers
- **Line 559**: Hardcoded array size limits
  - Description: Recent errors (100) and critical errors (50) limits are hardcoded instead of being configurable.

- **Line 639**: Hardcoded custom log limit
  - Description: `#self.customLogs > 1000` uses magic number that should be configurable.

- **Line 936**: Hardcoded monitoring time window
  - Description: 300 seconds (5 minutes) for error rate monitoring is hardcoded and should be configurable.

### Bad Practices/Code Quality
- **Line 184**: String concatenation in error classification
  - Description: Multiple string:find() calls could be optimized using pattern matching or a lookup table.

- **Line 452**: Method wrapping without preserving context
  - Description: `WrapServiceWithErrorBoundaries` doesn't preserve the original service context (self) when wrapping methods.

- **Line 901**: Inefficient error monitoring with adaptive intervals
  - Description: Adaptive interval calculation is recalculated every time instead of using cached values.

### Logic Issues
- **Line 315**: Recovery strategy execution without validation
  - Description: Recovery strategies are executed without validating that the required recovery functions exist.

- **Line 600**: Stack trace formatting assumes string format
  - Description: Stack trace formatting doesn't validate that `errorData.stackTrace` is actually a string.

- **Line 930**: Error rate spike detection false positives
  - Description: Error rate calculation doesn't account for server startup or deployment scenarios where initial errors are expected.

### Security/Robustness Issues
- **Line 418**: Error boundary exposes internal operation arguments
  - Description: Error details include operation arguments which could contain sensitive information.

- **Line 668**: External logging without data sanitization
  - Description: Error data is sent to external loggers without sanitizing potentially sensitive details.

### Unnecessary Code
- **Line 776**: Redundant alert message formatting
  - Description: Complex string formatting for alerts could be simplified or use a template system.

- **Line 853**: Redundant error level initialization
  - Description: Error level counts are initialized to 0 but this is unnecessary since Lua tables default to nil.

### Style/Consistency Issues
- **Line 19**: Inconsistent icon usage in error levels
  - Description: Some error levels use emoji icons while maintaining a professional logging service, creating mixed presentation styles.

- **Line 608**: Mixed logging method usage
  - Description: Uses both Roblox built-in methods (warn, print) and custom logging inconsistently throughout the service.
