## 🚀 USAGE GUIDELINES

### When to Use Basic Services:
```lua
-- Development, casual gameplay, standard requirements
AntiCheatService        -- Standard protection
PetService             -- Core pet functionality
```

### When to Use Advanced Services:
```lua
-- Competitive, high-performance, complex requirements  
AntiCheatServiceAdvanced    -- Optimized protection
PetOrchestrationService    -- Advanced coordination
```

### Environment-Based Loading:
```lua
local config = require(ReplicatedStorage.Shared.configuration.ServiceSpecializationConfig)
local services = config:GetServicesForEnvironment("competitive")
-- Automatically loads appropriate services for environment
```

## 📊 TRANSFORMATION RESULTS

### **Before Option 2C:**
- ❓ Unclear service roles ("Optimized" vs regular)
- ❓ Ambiguous when to use which service
- ❓ No clear specialization strategy

### **After Option 2C:**
- ✅ **Clear service tiers** with defined roles
- ✅ **Environment-based configuration** for smart loading
- ✅ **Professional architecture** with separation of concerns
- ✅ **Scalable design** that grows with requirements
