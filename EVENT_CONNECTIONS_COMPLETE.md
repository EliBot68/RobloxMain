if newState == "STARTING" or newState == "PLAYING" then
    recordingManager:StartRecording(player, gameData)
end

-- Auto-stop recording on game end
if newState == "ENDED" or newState == "RESETTING" then
    replayData = recordingManager:StopRecording(player, gameData)
    recordingManager:SaveReplayData(player, replayData, gameData)
end

-- Pause/Resume recording
if newState == "PAUSED" then
    recordingManager:PauseRecording(player)
elseif previousState == "PAUSED" and newState == "PLAYING" then
    recordingManager:ResumeRecording(player)
end
```

### Analytics Bindings
```lua
-- Track all state transitions
analyticsService:TrackEvent(player, "game_state_change", {
    previousState = previousState,
    newState = newState,
    duration = stateDuration,
    sessionId = sessionId
})

-- Real-time gameplay analytics
if newState == "PLAYING" then
    -- Start periodic updates every 5 seconds
    StartRealTimeAnalytics(player, sessionData)
end

-- Game completion analytics
if newState == "ENDED" then
    analyticsService:TrackEvent(player, "game_ended", {
        totalDuration = sessionDuration,
        finalScore = gameData.finalScore,
        completionRate = gameData.completionRate
    })
end
```

### System Reset Bindings
```lua
-- Complete system reset on RESETTING state
if newState == "RESETTING" then
    -- Reset all services
    mainController:ResetPlayerGame(player)
    collisionController:ResetPlayerCollisions(player)
    trackGenerator:ClearPlayerTrack(player)
    difficultyService:ResetPlayerDifficulty(player)
    
    -- Clear session data

- `collision_detected` - Player collision events

## Error Handling

### Spawn Failure Recovery
- **Automatic Retry**: Failed spawns are automatically retried up to 3 times
- **Timeout Protection**: 30-second timeout prevents infinite spawn attempts
- **Phase Tracking**: Detailed tracking of which spawn phase failed
