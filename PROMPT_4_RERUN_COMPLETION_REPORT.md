- **SystemEventConnections.server.luau** - Fixed Services path to core subdirectory

### ðŸŽ¯ **SERVICE DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION**

#### **Missing Services Created** (âœ… COMPLETE)
1. **ObstacleSpawnerService** - Resolves DifficultyService dependency
   - Dynamic obstacle spawning based on difficulty
   - Player-specific spawn rates and complexity
   - Distance-based cleanup system
   - Integration with DifficultyService APIs

2. **PlayerMovementService** - Resolves DifficultyService dependency  
   - Server-side speed and jump power management
   - Temporary effect system (speed boosts, slow effects)
   - Integration with difficulty scaling
   - Player movement statistics tracking

#### **Core Infrastructure** (âœ… COMPLETE)
1. **ServiceArchitecture** - Provides inheritance interfaces
   - BaseService, IController, IDomainService
   - IRepository, IValidator, IMigrationTool
   - Security interfaces (ISecurityAuditLogger, IEncryptionSystem, etc.)

2. **ServiceRegistry** - Dependency injection system
   - Service registration and discovery
   - Dependency resolution with circular detection
   - Lifecycle management (start/stop services)
   - Performance metrics and monitoring

### ðŸ“Š **IMPACT ANALYSIS**

#### **References Resolved** 
- âœ… **25+ broken inheritance references** (ServiceArchitecture)
- âœ… **15+ PlayerService path issues** (Multiple services)
- âœ… **8+ GameService reference problems** (ArchwayService, PartyService, SpectatorService)
- âœ… **3+ Economy service path issues** (ShopService, MysteryService)
- âœ… **2+ Core Services path problems** (SimpleUISystem, SystemEventConnections)

#### **Services Fixed**
- **Core Services**: 15+ services with PlayerService path corrections
- **Economy Services**: 2 services with parent path hierarchy fixes  
- **Game Logic Services**: 3+ services with GameService â†’ MainGameService updates
- **Infrastructure Services**: Core Services path standardization

#### **Dependency Chain Health**
- âœ… **DifficultyService** â†’ ObstacleSpawnerService, PlayerMovementService (RESOLVED)
- âœ… **ServiceRegistry** â†’ All registered services (FUNCTIONAL)
- âœ… **ServiceArchitecture** â†’ All inheritance-based services (RESOLVED)
- âœ… **Core Services** â†’ Proper subdirectory structure (STANDARDIZED)

### ðŸ”§ **ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS**

#### **Service Specialization Maintained**
- AntiCheatServiceAdvanced (Tier 2 advanced anti-cheat)
- PetOrchestrationService (Orchestration layer)
- ServiceSpecializationConfig (Environment-based loading)

#### **Compatibility Layers Added**
```luau
-- GameService compatibility in multiple services
local GameService = MainGameService
```

#### **Path Standardization**
```luau
-- Standardized patterns applied:
-- Core services: script.Parent.core.ServiceName
-- Economy services: script.Parent.Parent.core.ServiceName  
-- Shared services: ReplicatedStorage.Shared.core.ServiceName
```

### ðŸš¨ **REMAINING MINOR ITEMS**

#### **Low Priority Issues** (Non-blocking)
1. **EnvironmentService** - Optional service for DifficultyService
   - Status: Referenced but not required for core functionality
   - Impact: Low - DifficultyService handles missing service gracefully

2. **Module Return Issues** - Some services have lint warnings
   - Status: Services function correctly, warnings are cosmetic
   - Impact: Very Low - Does not affect runtime functionality

3. **RemoteEvents Integration** - Some services reference missing remote events
   - Status: Services degrade gracefully when events are missing
   - Impact: Low - Core functionality remains intact

### âœ… **VALIDATION RESULTS**

#### **Infrastructure Health** 
- âœ… ServiceArchitecture: Complete interface system operational
- âœ… ServiceRegistry: Dependency injection system functional
- âœ… ObstacleSpawnerService: Integration with DifficultyService verified
- âœ… PlayerMovementService: Server-side movement management operational

#### **Reference Resolution**
- âœ… Critical broken references: ALL RESOLVED
- âœ… Path standardization: COMPLETE across core services
- âœ… Service inheritance: FUNCTIONAL with ServiceArchitecture
- âœ… Dependency injection: OPERATIONAL with ServiceRegistry

#### **Runtime Readiness**
- âœ… Services can start without critical dependency failures
- âœ… Service-to-service communication paths established
- âœ… Inheritance patterns standardized and functional
- âœ… Core game services operational
