- **Orchestration:** Clean coordination without business logic

### 2. Single Responsibility Principle
- Each component has one focused responsibility
- Easy to understand, test, and maintain
- Clear ownership of functionality

### 3. Clean Interfaces
- Repository implements `IRepository` for consistent data operations
- Domain services implement `IDomainService` for business logic
- Orchestrator extends `BaseService` for lifecycle management

### 4. Enhanced Testability
- Components can be tested in isolation
- Mock dependencies easily injected
- Comprehensive test coverage possible

### 5. Improved Maintainability
- Changes isolated to specific components
- Easy to add new analytics features
- Clear code organization and documentation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Event Logging
```lua
local AnalyticsService = require(ReplicatedStorage.Server.services.Analytics.AnalyticsServiceOrchestrator)

-- Log a simple event
AnalyticsService:LogEvent(player, "coin_collected", {
    coinsEarned = 10,
    totalCoins = 150
})

-- Track run lifecycle
AnalyticsService:TrackRunStart(player, 0)
AnalyticsService:TrackBarrierAttempt(player, 5, "RED", true)
AnalyticsService:TrackRunEnd(player, 100, 50, 30)
```

### Custom Event Validation
```lua
-- Add custom validator for purchase events
AnalyticsService:AddEventValidator("custom_purchase", function(data)
    return data.itemId and data.cost and data.cost > 0
end)

-- Add custom enricher for combat events
AnalyticsService:AddEventEnricher("combat_event", function(player, data)
    data.playerLevel = GetPlayerLevel(player)
    data.weaponEquipped = GetPlayerWeapon(player)
    return data
end)
```

### Reporting and Analytics
```lua
-- Get real-time metrics
local metrics = AnalyticsService:GetRealtimeMetrics()
print("Active Players:", metrics.activePlayerCount)
print("Events/Min:", metrics.eventsPerMinute)

-- Generate insights
local insights = AnalyticsService:GenerateInsights()
for _, recommendation in ipairs(insights.recommendations.difficulty) do
    print("Difficulty Recommendation:", recommendation)
end

-- Export reports
local jsonReport = AnalyticsService:ExportReport("hourly", "json")
-- Send to external analytics platform
```

## Configuration

### HTTP Endpoint Configuration
```lua
AnalyticsService:ConfigureEndpoint(
    "https://your-analytics-service.com/api/events",
    "your-api-key",
    true -- enabled
)
```

### Custom Event Filtering
```lua
AnalyticsService:AddEventFilter("production_filter", function(player, eventType, data)
    -- Filter out test events in production
    if not game:GetService("RunService"):IsStudio() then
        return not eventType:match("^test_")
    end
    return true
end)
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Buffer Management
- Events are buffered in memory before batch transmission
- Automatic flushing every 30 seconds or when buffer reaches capacity
- Configurable batch sizes for optimal performance

### 2. Memory Usage
- Automatic cleanup of old events and inactive sessions
- Bounded data structures prevent memory leaks
- Efficient data structures for fast operations

### 3. Network Optimization
- Batch HTTP requests reduce network overhead
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Configurable timeouts and error handling

## Migration Guide

### From Original AnalyticsService

The refactored service maintains full backward compatibility:

```lua
-- Old usage (still works)
AnalyticsService:LogEvent(player, "run_start", data)
AnalyticsService:TrackEvent(player, "barrier_match", data)
AnalyticsService:OnPlayerJoined(player)

-- New features
AnalyticsService:GetRealtimeMetrics()
AnalyticsService:GenerateInsights()
AnalyticsService:AddEventValidator("custom", validator)
```

### Service Registration

The orchestrator automatically registers with the ServiceRegistry:

```lua
local ServiceRegistry = require(ReplicatedStorage.Shared.core.ServiceRegistry)
local analyticsService = ServiceRegistry:GetService("AnalyticsService")
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite validates all components:

```lua
-- Run analytics tests
local testResults = require(ReplicatedStorage.Shared.tests.TestAnalyticsRefactoring)
```

Test coverage includes:
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for component interaction
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Performance and reliability testing

## Health Monitoring

### Service Health
```lua
local health = AnalyticsService:GetHealth()
print("Service Health:", health.isHealthy)
print("Status:", health.status)
```

### Service Statistics
```lua
local stats = AnalyticsService:GetServiceStatistics()
print("Buffer Size:", stats.repository.bufferSize)
print("Active Sessions:", stats.activePlayerCount)
print("Uptime:", stats.uptime)
```

## Future Enhancements
