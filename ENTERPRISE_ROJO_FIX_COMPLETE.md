- **Implemented proper Rojo naming conventions** (.lua extensions, proper init files)
- **Added comprehensive remote events and functions** for client-server communication
- **Optimized glob ignore patterns** to exclude unnecessary files from sync

### 🏗️ 2. Enterprise Service Architecture - FULLY OPERATIONAL
- **EnterpriseServiceArchitecture.luau** - Dependency injection container with circuit breakers
- **EnterpriseDataService.luau** - Distributed data management with caching and real-time sync
- **EnterpriseAnalyticsService.luau** - Advanced analytics with ML and business intelligence
- **EnterprisePlayerService.luau** - Comprehensive player lifecycle management
- **EnterpriseSecurityService.luau** - Anti-cheat and real-time threat detection
- **EnterpriseMonitoringService.luau** - System health monitoring with admin dashboard
- **EnterpriseGameController.luau** - Master orchestrator for all game systems

### 🔄 3. Proper Init Files - ROJO COMPLIANT
- **Created init.server.lua** - Main server entry point following Rojo conventions
- **Created init.client.lua** - Main client entry point with enterprise UI and performance monitoring
- **Removed corrupted .luau files** that were causing UTF-8 encoding issues
- **Implemented proper service registration and startup sequence**
