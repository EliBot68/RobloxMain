# Complete Game Lifecycle Management System

## Overview

The Game Lifecycle Management System provides comprehensive control over the entire game lifecycle from server startup to game end, including service initialization, automatic game loop management, and complete system resets.

## Architecture Components

### 1. GameLifecycleManager.server.luau ✅
**Purpose**: Master lifecycle controller managing the complete game lifecycle
**Location**: `src/server/GameLifecycleManager.server.luau`

#### Features:
- **Service Initialization Management**: Waits for and validates all core services

#### Lifecycle States:
```
STARTING → READY → GAME_ACTIVE → RESETTING → READY
```

### 2. Enhanced Core Services Integration ✅
**Total Services**: 11 core services with proper initialization order

#### Service Loading Order:
1. **GameService** (Core game mechanics)
2. **AnalyticsService** (Event tracking)

## Complete Lifecycle Flow

### 1. Server Start Initialization ✅
```
Server Starts → InitializeCoreServices → Wait for All Services → GameLifecycleManager → Auto-Start Game Loop
```

#### Process:
1. **Core Services Load**: All 11 services initialize in proper order
2. **Service Validation**: GameLifecycleManager waits for all services to be ready
3. **State Transition**: STARTING → READY
4. **Auto-Start**: Game loop automatically starts after 15-second delay
5. **Health Monitoring**: Continuous system health checks begin

### 2. Game Loop Management ✅
```
Game Loop Active → Monitor Players → Start Games for LOBBY Players → Update Active Games → Clean Finished Games
```

#### Process:
1. **Player Detection**: Identifies players in LOBBY state needing games
2. **Game Initiation**: Automatically transitions players to PREPARING state
3. **Session Management**: Tracks all active game sessions
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Updates game progress and handles timeouts
5. **Cleanup**: Removes finished game sessions and resources

### 3. System Reset Process ✅
```
Reset Trigger → Stop Game Loop → Reset All Players → Reset Core Services → Clear System State → Return to READY
```

#### Process:
1. **Reset Initiation**: Via admin command or automatic health failure
2. **Game Loop Stop**: Immediately stops all game loop operations
3. **Player Reset**: All players transitioned to RESETTING then LOBBY state
4. **Service Reset**: All core services reset to initial state
5. **State Cleanup**: System metrics reset, sessions cleared
6. **Auto-Restart**: Game loop automatically restarts after reset

## Admin Control System ✅

### Chat Commands
```
/start or /startgame - Start the game loop
/stop or /stopgame - Stop the game loop  
/reset or /resetall - Reset all systems
/restart - Restart the game loop
/status - Get system status report
/reset PlayerName - Reset specific player
/help - Show available commands
```

### GUI Panel (F9 Key)
- **System Status**: Real-time lifecycle state, player count, uptime, memory usage
- **Control Buttons**: One-click lifecycle controls
- **Player Management**: Individual player reset buttons
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded status indicators

### Admin User Configuration
```lua
local LIFECYCLE_CONFIG = {
    adminUserIds = {}, -- Add admin user IDs here
    autoStartGameLoop = true,
    autoStartDelay = 15,
    enableAdminCommands = true
}
```

## Configuration Options

### Lifecycle Configuration
```lua
local LIFECYCLE_CONFIG = {
    enableDetailedLogging = true,        -- Detailed operation logging
    autoStartGameLoop = true,            -- Auto-start game loop on server start
    autoStartDelay = 15,                 -- Seconds to wait before auto-start
    enableAdminCommands = true,          -- Enable chat-based admin commands
    gameLoopInterval = 1,                -- Seconds between game loop iterations
    enableSystemHealthMonitoring = true, -- Enable health monitoring
    healthCheckInterval = 30,            -- Seconds between health checks
    enableAutoRestart = true,            -- Auto-restart on health failure
    maxPlayers = 50,                     -- Maximum concurrent players
    adminUserIds = {}                    -- Admin user IDs
}
```

### Game Loop Settings
```lua
gameLoopSettings = {
    autoStartGames = true,               -- Automatically start games for lobby players
    maxConcurrentGames = 50,             -- Maximum concurrent game sessions
    gameTimeout = 300,                   -- Game timeout in seconds (5 minutes)
    minPlayersPerGame = 1,               -- Minimum players per game
    maxPlayersPerGame = 1                -- Maximum players per game (Color Rush is single player)
}
```

## System Health Monitoring ✅

### Health Checks
- **Core Services Availability**: Validates all 11 services are accessible
- **Game Loop Health**: Verifies game loop is functioning correctly
- **Memory Usage**: Monitors server memory consumption
- **Player Count**: Tracks concurrent player count
- **Session Management**: Monitors active game sessions for timeouts

### Auto-Recovery
- **Service Failure**: Automatic service reinitialization
- **Game Loop Failure**: Automatic game loop restart
- **Health Degradation**: Complete system reset if critical issues detected
- **Session Recovery**: Automatic cleanup of unhealthy game sessions

## Performance Metrics ✅

### Tracked Metrics
```lua
SystemStatus = {
    lifecycleState = "READY",            -- Current lifecycle state
    coreServicesReady = true,            -- Core services status
    gameLoopActive = true,               -- Game loop status
    playerCount = 0,                     -- Current player count
    systemHealth = "healthy",            -- Overall system health
    uptime = 0,                          -- Server uptime in seconds
    gamesPlayed = 0,                     -- Total games played
    totalResets = 0                      -- Total system resets
}
```

### Analytics Integration
All lifecycle events are automatically tracked:
- `system_ready` - System transition to ready state
- `game_loop_started` - Game loop activation
- `game_loop_stopped` - Game loop deactivation
- `system_health_check` - Health monitoring results
- `game_session_ended` - Individual game completion
- `systems_reset` - System reset events

## Global Accessors ✅

### Lifecycle Management
```lua
_G.GetGameLifecycleManager()             -- Get lifecycle manager
_G.StartGameLoop()                       -- Start game loop
_G.StopGameLoop()                        -- Stop game loop
_G.ResetAllSystems()                     -- Reset all systems
```

### Status Reporting
```lua
local manager = _G.GetGameLifecycleManager()
local state = manager:GetLifecycleState()          -- Get current state
local active = manager:IsGameLoopActive()          -- Check game loop status
local status = manager:GetSystemStatus()           -- Get full status report
```

## Testing and Validation ✅
