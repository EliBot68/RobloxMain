# Professional Lighting Implementation - Complete

## 🎬 Professional Lighting Settings Applied

The game now uses **industry-standard professional lighting settings** across all systems for a polished, production-ready visual experience.

## ✅ Core Professional Settings Implemented

### **Main Lighting Properties:**
```lua
Lighting.Brightness = 1                    -- Professional baseline brightness
Lighting.ExposureCompensation = -0.5       -- Darker tone for better visibility
Lighting.Ambient = Color3.fromRGB(80, 80, 80)       -- Subtle ambient lighting
Lighting.OutdoorAmbient = Color3.fromRGB(100, 100, 100)  -- Balanced outdoor ambient
```

### **Color Correction Effect:**
```lua
ColorCorrectionEffect.Brightness = -0.1    -- Slight brightness reduction
ColorCorrectionEffect.Contrast = 0.05      -- Subtle contrast enhancement  
ColorCorrectionEffect.Saturation = 0.9     -- Professional desaturation
```

### **Professional Atmosphere:**
- **Density**: 0.3 (subtle depth)
- **Glare**: 0.2 (reduced for comfort)
- **Fog**: 500-2000 range for professional depth
