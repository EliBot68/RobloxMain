# Anti-Cheat System Implementation Complete

## Overview
A comprehensive anti-cheat system has been implemented to detect and prevent common exploits including speed hacks, teleporting, and illegal stat changes. The system provides multi-layered protection with both server-side validation and client-side monitoring.

## System Architecture

### Server-Side Components

#### AntiCheatService (`src/server/services/AntiCheatService.luau`)
**Primary Functions:**
- Movement validation (position/teleport detection)
- Speed monitoring (sustained high-speed detection) 
- Stat validation (coins/XP/score rate limiting)
- Violation tracking and automated enforcement
- Administrative tools for violation management

**Key Features:**
- **Position Monitoring**: Tracks player positions with configurable validation intervals
- **Speed Detection**: Monitors movement speed with tolerance for legitimate gameplay
- **Teleport Detection**: Identifies impossible position changes exceeding distance thresholds
- **Stat Rate Limiting**: Prevents rapid stat changes beyond configured limits
- **Violation System**: Progressive warnings → kicks → temporary bans → permanent bans
- **Admin Commands**: Violation reset, player whitelisting, detailed reporting

#### Enhanced JumpService
**Anti-Cheat Additions:**
- Jump frequency monitoring (spam protection)
- Pattern analysis for impossible timing
- Integration with main AntiCheatService for violation reporting
- Gradual suspicious counter reduction for normal behavior

### Client-Side Components

#### AntiCheatClient (`src/client/AntiCheatClient.luau`)
**Primary Functions:**
- Exploit environment detection
- Input pattern monitoring
- Performance anomaly detection
- UI modification monitoring
- Warning system for players

**Key Features:**
- **Exploit Detection**: Identifies common exploit tools and environments
- **Input Monitoring**: Analyzes input patterns for automation/scripting
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors FPS and performance for anomalies
- **UI Protection**: Detects unauthorized UI modifications
- **Player Warnings**: Progressive warning system before server enforcement

## Configuration

### Server Settings (AntiCheatService)
```lua
ANTI_CHEAT_CONFIG = {
    -- Position Monitoring
    positionCheckInterval = 1,     -- Check every 1 second
    maxTeleportDistance = 50,      -- Max distance for valid movement
    
    -- Speed Monitoring  
    speedCheckInterval = 2,        -- Check every 2 seconds
    maxAllowedSpeed = 25,          -- Max sustained speed
    speedViolationThreshold = 3,   -- Violations before action
    
    -- Stat Protection
    maxCoinsPerSecond = 10,        -- Rate limit for coin gains
    maxXpPerSecond = 15,           -- Rate limit for XP gains
    statCheckInterval = 1,         -- Stat validation frequency
    
    -- Violation System
    maxWarnings = 3,               -- Warnings before kick
    kickCooldown = 300,            -- 5 minute kick duration
    banDuration = 86400,           -- 24 hour temp ban
}
```

### Client Settings (AntiCheatClient)
```lua
CLIENT_CONFIG = {
    -- Monitoring Intervals
    exploitCheckInterval = 5,      -- Check every 5 seconds
    inputCheckInterval = 3,        -- Monitor input every 3 seconds
    performanceCheckInterval = 10, -- Performance check frequency
    
    -- Detection Thresholds
    maxInputRate = 20,             -- Max inputs per second
    minFpsThreshold = 10,          -- Min FPS before flagging
    maxFpsThreshold = 200,         -- Max FPS before flagging
    
    -- Warning System
    warningDisplayTime = 5,        -- Warning display duration
    maxClientWarnings = 5,         -- Client warnings before report
}
```

## Integration Points

### RemoteEvents Added
- `ReportSuspiciousActivity` - Client reports to server
- `ShowAntiCheatWarning` - Server sends warnings to client
- `AntiCheatKick` - Server kick notifications
- `AntiCheatViolation` - Violation logging
- `HeartbeatCheck` - Connection verification
- `RequestDataValidation` - Data integrity checks
- `AdminViolationReset` - Admin violation management
- `AdminWhitelistPlayer` - Admin whitelist controls

### Service Initialization
- **Server**: Added to `infrastructureServices` in `init.server.luau`
- **Client**: Added to controller initialization in `init.client.luau`
- **Dependencies**: Integrated with existing player data and analytics systems

## Detection Capabilities

### Speed Hacks
- **Server**: Monitors sustained movement speed above thresholds
- **Client**: Detects performance anomalies indicating speed manipulation
- **Action**: Progressive warnings → kicks → temporary bans

### Teleporting
- **Server**: Validates position changes against distance/time thresholds
- **Client**: Monitors for impossible position jumps
- **Action**: Immediate kick for severe violations

### Stat Manipulation
- **Server**: Rate-limits stat changes (coins, XP, score) with configurable thresholds
- **Client**: Monitors for suspicious stat change patterns
- **Action**: Stat reversion + violation tracking

### Exploit Tools
- **Client**: Detects common exploit environments and tools
- **Server**: Receives reports and validates with behavioral analysis
- **Action**: Immediate kick + enhanced monitoring

## Administrative Features

### Admin Commands (Server)
```lua
-- Reset player violations
AntiCheatService:ResetViolations(player)

-- Whitelist player (bypass checks)
AntiCheatService:WhitelistPlayer(player, duration)

-- Get violation report
local report = AntiCheatService:GetViolationReport(player)

-- Manual violation flag
AntiCheatService:FlagViolation(player, violationType, data)
```

### Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time violation tracking
- Player behavior analytics
- Automated enforcement logs
- Whitelist management

## Testing & Validation

### Recommended Tests
1. **Position Validation**: Test teleportation detection with various distances
2. **Speed Monitoring**: Validate speed thresholds with different movement methods
3. **Stat Protection**: Test rate limiting with rapid stat changes
4. **Client Detection**: Verify exploit environment detection
5. **Progressive Enforcement**: Test warning → kick → ban progression

### Performance Impact
- **Server**: Minimal overhead with optimized checking intervals
- **Client**: Lightweight monitoring with configurable frequencies
- **Network**: Efficient event-based reporting system

## Security Considerations

### Protection Layers
1. **Server Authority**: All critical validation on server-side
2. **Client Monitoring**: Early detection and warning system
3. **Progressive Enforcement**: Graduated response system
4. **Admin Override**: Manual control for edge cases
5. **Whitelist System**: Bypass for authorized users

### Bypass Prevention
- Multiple validation methods for same exploit type
- Randomized checking intervals to prevent timing attacks
- Server-side data validation independent of client reports
- Administrative logging for all enforcement actions

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Review violation logs** for new exploit patterns
2. **Adjust thresholds** based on gameplay analytics
3. **Update detection methods** for new exploit tools
4. **Monitor false positive rates** and adjust sensitivity
5. **Update whitelist** for authorized testing accounts

### Performance Monitoring
- Track anti-cheat system resource usage
- Monitor false positive/negative rates
- Analyze enforcement effectiveness
- Review player feedback and appeals

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Machine Learning**: Pattern recognition for sophisticated exploits
2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Long-term player behavior profiling
3. **Community Reporting**: Player-driven violation reporting
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed exploit trend analysis
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced detection for mobile-specific exploits

### Integration Opportunities
1. **DataStore**: Permanent violation history storage
2. **Analytics**: Integration with game analytics platform
3. **Discord Integration**: Admin notifications and reporting
4. **External APIs**: Third-party anti-cheat services
5. **Automated Appeals**: Player violation appeal system

## Conclusion
