# Prompt 9: RecordingSessionManager Integration - COMPLETE

## Overview
Successfully integrated the RecordingSessionManager with MainGameController to automatically start and stop recording sessions during gameplay. The system now captures game footage, stores replay data per player, and provides comprehensive recording management.

## ‚úÖ Integration Points Implemented

### üé¨ Game Start Recording Hook
**Location:** `MainGameController:StartGame()` - Line ~1052

```lua
-- üé¨ START RECORDING SESSION
self:StartGameRecording()
```

**What it does:**
- Automatically starts recording for all active players when game begins
- Creates recording sessions with configurable duration
- Links recordings to the game session for tracking
- Logs recording start to analytics

### üèÅ Game End Recording Hook  
**Location:** `MainGameController:EndGame()` - Line ~1213

```lua
-- üé¨ STOP RECORDING SESSION
self:StopGameRecording(reason, results, gameDuration)
```

**What it does:**
- Stops all active recording sessions when game ends
- Saves replay data with game results and player performance
- Calculates game quality metrics for highlight detection
- Stores comprehensive replay information

### üëã Player Cleanup Hook
**Location:** `MainGameController:OnPlayerRemoving()` - Line ~559

```lua
-- üé¨ CLEANUP RECORDING SESSION
self:CleanupPlayerRecording(player)
```

**What it does:**
- Properly cleans up recording data when players leave
- Stops active recordings for departing players
- Prevents memory leaks and orphaned sessions

### üîÑ Lobby Reset Hook
**Location:** `MainGameController:ResetToLobby()` - Line ~1247

```lua
-- üé¨ CLEANUP ALL RECORDING SESSIONS
self:CleanupAllRecordingSessions()
```

**What it does:**
- Cleans up all recording sessions when returning to lobby
- Ensures fresh state for next game
- Prevents recording session overlap
