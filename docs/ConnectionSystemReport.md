## 🎯 **How to Use the System**

### **For New Services (Recommended)**
```lua
local ServiceConnectionHelper = require(ReplicatedStorage.Shared.utils.ServiceConnectionHelper)
local helper = ServiceConnectionHelper.CreateServiceHelper("MyService")

-- All connections are automatically managed
helper:ConnectPlayerEvent("PlayerAdded", callback)
helper:ConnectRemoteEvent(remoteEvent, callback)
helper:ConnectGUIEvent(button, "MouseButton1Click", callback)

-- Automatic cleanup
helper:CleanupAll()
```

### **For Existing Services (Migration)**
1. Run `ConnectionMigrationHelper` to scan for issues
2. Replace direct connections with managed ones
3. Add cleanup methods to all services
4. Test thoroughly

---

## 🔍 **Memory Leak Prevention Features**

### **Before (Risky)**
```lua
-- MEMORY LEAK RISK!
Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    -- Connection never cleaned up
end)
```

### **After (Safe)**
```lua
-- MEMORY SAFE!
helper:ConnectPlayerEvent("PlayerAdded", function(player)
    -- Automatically cleaned up when player leaves
end)
```
